You are a web developer tasked with creating an interactive React website. The homepage should feature three prominent project buttons, each leading to a specific project with the following headings:

1. **Project One**: Process Synchronization
2. **Project Two**: Multithreading
3. **Project Three**: Virtual Memory and Paging

Your goals are as follows:

### Project Structure and Implementation Steps:

1. **Set Up the React Application**:
- Use Create React App to initialize the project.
- Ensure the necessary packages for animations (e.g., React Spring or Framer Motion) are included.

2. **Design the Home Screen**:
- Create a visually appealing layout for the buttons with engaging UI elements.
- Implement hover effects and animations for buttons to enhance user experience.

3. **Implement Projects**:
- For each project button, redirect to a dedicated route/page upon click.

#### Project Details:
- **Process Synchronization**:
- Provide a concise explanation of process synchronization.
- Include a Java example code snippet showcasing a method or tool used for process synchronization (e.g., Semaphore or Monitor).

- **Multithreading**:
- Discuss the importance of multithreading in Java applications.
- Present a Java example that illustrates multithreading in practice (e.g., using Runnable interface or Thread class).

- **Virtual Memory and Paging**:
- Explain the concept of virtual memory and its significance.
- Provide a Java example involving a simulation or algorithm that represents virtual memory management (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement).

### Additional Requirements:
- Ensure each page has a consistent style and navigation.
- Incorporate animations when transitioning between pages.
- Utilize responsive design to ensure compatibility on various screen sizes.

### Output:
Your final output should include:
- The React application codebase structured clearly.
- Each project implemented with the required Java example and explanation.
- A README file including setup instructions and explanations for the UI design choices and any libraries used.

Create your responsive and dynamic React website, ensuring that it is user-friendly while effectively highlighting the core concepts of each project.
